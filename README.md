# About Stellarium
Stellarium is an open-source free-software planetarium.

In terms of sky features, over 600,000 stars from the Hipparcos Catalogue and the Tycho-2 Catalogue are accessible, as well as more than 210 million stars from additional catalogues.

Stellarium also provides asterisms and illustrations of constellations from ten cultures, images of nebulae (full Messier catalogue), and many realistic representations. The Milky Way, atmosphere, sunrise, planets of the solar system, and their major moons are all represented in the application. Users can also display stars and other celestial objects as seen from reference points other than the Earth.
